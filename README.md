-   ### <em>Manual Testing:</em>
This section will cover the manual testing of all the features of this application. The purpose of manual testing is to identify any potential bugs or issues in the application's functionalities. The following steps were repeated multiple times from early development. The project was deployed to Heroku early so that I could test the features throughout the development of this project.
The website was sent to as many friends, colleagues and family members as possible for testing and feedback.
